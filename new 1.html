	<h1>INFORMATION ABOUT PLANETS</h1>
	<p>The Solar System is a gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. 
	   The largest of these objects are the eight planets, which in order from the Sun are four 
	   terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn);
	   and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune) 1. The four outer planets, also called giant planets 
	   or Jovian planets, collectively make up 99% of the mass known to orbit the Sun. Jupiter and 
	   Saturn are together more than 400 times the mass of Earth and consist overwhelmingly of the 
	   gases hydrogen and helium, hence their designation as gas giants .

	   The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot 
	   plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.
	   It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109
	   times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about
	   99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System</p>

	<h2>Mercury: The smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. It has no moons and no atmosphere</h2>
	<img src="images.jpg" alt="images" width="500" height="333">
	<h2>Venus: is the second planet from the Sun and is the second largest terrestrial planet. It has a thick atmosphere
	that traps heat and makes Venus very hot</h2>
	<img src="venus.jpg" alt="images" width="500" height="333">
	<h2>Earth: is the third planet from the Sun and is the only planet known to support life</h2>
	<img src="earth.jpg" alt="images" width="500" height="500">
	<h2>Mars: is a cold desert world that is half the size of Earth. It has a thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon</h2>
	<img src="mars.jpg" alt="images" width="500" height="333">
	<h2>Jupiter: is the largest planet in the solar system and is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume) and helium. It has a faint
	planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere, and forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large
	moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto</h2>
	<img src="jupiter.jpg" alt="images" width="500" height="500">
	<h2>Saturn:is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. It is a gas giant with an average radius
	of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. It has a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere, and forms a system of 95 
	known moons and probably many more</h2>
	<img src="saturn.jpg" alt="images" width="500" height="333">
	<h2>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is blue-green in color due to large amounts of methane in its atmosphere. It has a unique
	tilt that makes it appear to spin on its side</h2>
	<img src="uranaus.jpg" alt="images" width="500" height="333">
	<H2>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter. It is an ice giant, similar
	to a gas giant, and is made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane flowing over a solid core about the size of Earth</h2>
